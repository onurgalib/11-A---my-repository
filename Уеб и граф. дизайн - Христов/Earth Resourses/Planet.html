    <p class="right-paragraph">Earth is the third planet from the
        Sun and the only astronomical 
        object known to harbor life.
        According to radiometric dating and 
        other sources of evidence, Earth
        formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 
        with respect to its orbital plane,
        producing seasons on Earth. The
        gravitational interaction between 
        Earth and the Moon causes tides,
        stabilizes Earth's orientation on its 
        axis, and gradually slows its 
        rotation.</p>
